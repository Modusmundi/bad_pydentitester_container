# Bad Pydentitester Dockerfile

This is an intentionally bad Dockerfile with which we will demonstrate how to create a build/scan/report pipeline using Github actions.

Notably, it uses a real gross set of libs pulled down from pypi as well as really bad security practices to show off just how bad things can be.

All contents with the exception of the Openscap Github action are distributed under the provided LICENSE file.

Openscap Github Action is based off of prior work from Craig Andrews (https://candrews.integralblue.com/2023/09/scap-security-and-compliance-scanning-of-docker-images-in-github-actions-and-gitlab-ci/).

Be excellent to each other, dudes.
