# Bad Pydentitester Dockerfile

This is an intentionally bad Dockerfile with which we will demonstrate how to create a build/scan/report pipeline using Github actions.

Notably, it uses a real gross set of libs pulled down from pypi as well as really bad security practices to show off just how bad things can be.
